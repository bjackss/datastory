# \#ACreativeDC

## Why

  Following Richard Florida’s proclamation in his landmark *Rise of the Creative Class* creativity has become a kind of economic barometer for cities in the United States. Places from Columbus, Ohio to Lincoln, Nebraska are making major city-planning decisions around how to find “creatives” and convince them to move. While Florida’s work has become a call-to-arms for those in fields such as marketing or urban planning, among those concerned with gentrification and displacement, the rise of the creative class has become synonymous with the neoliberalization of urban space. This seemingly small shift of verbiage from expanding the urban economy to expanding the creative base has seismic effects in terms of who is and is not welcome in America’s cities. What work is creative enough to be deemed so? Where would a creative want to live? What resources make city-life easier on a creative? 
  <p> Given the semiotically dense nature of the word in relation to American cities, the hashtag, #ACreativeDC greatly interests me. The earliest use of the hashtag dates to January of 2015 and it maintains an active following on both twitter and Instagram.</p> 

## How
 <p>I conducted my search broadly just considering the use of #ACreativeDC. Given the place-specificity of the hashtag I did not feel the need to put geographic parameters on the search. With the tools at my disposal I honed in on the location of the tweets provided by users. Unsurprisingly the vast majority (around 50%) were from some variant of “Wasington D.C. Surprisingly, the next most common were Annapolis, MD followed by Melbourne Australia. I think the use of this hashtag in the suburbs is interesting and telling in terms of how twitter users live and imagine the boundaries of D.C. I am also very interested in its use far away from the district, it would be interesting to examine how people hold onto attachment to the city after they leave it.</p>

## Future Research
  <p> I believe that this project could be expanded in a number of ways to make it a more rich and telling data story. I believe that an organized geocode data set from these tweets would help to chart out the “creative” hubs of the city. This data could make for a fruitful mapping project, I would be interested in investigating how the use of this tag conforms to ongoing development projects, whether people are employing it at home or at work, and in what creative happenings take place in the dark corners of the Creative DC map, and why users wouldn’t employ the hashtag.</p> 
 <p>  A comprehensive analysis of twitter bios from users of the hashtag could also flesh out this analysis. I would be interested to see what occupations if any users list to follow the question of what is creative labor to those who self-identify as creatives. I would be interested to see how many users claim D.C. in their twitter bios or how many users adopt the cosmopolitan model of a string of their urban haunts separated by the always-on-the-go emoji e.g. D.C.:airplane:PHL:airplane:N.Y.C.</p> 
  <p> I think this project could also be expanded to compare D.C. against other cities that are established as creative hubs such as Los Angeles or New York. To the best of my knowledge, no such hashtag exists for those cities, as it is seemingly self-evident that these are creative spaces. I imagine that Washington’s identity as a city of bureaucratic work alongside its long history of failing to recognize artists of color in their own time are probably to blame for this sudden move to show off a new arena of creative labor.</p> 
  <p> I hope to expand my skills in sourcing and analyzing social media data. As this new mode of being has re-shaped what it means to inhabit a place, I feel tweets and Instagram posts are now essential for understanding the construction of space. As urban space continues to be hotly contested, who claims the right to the city and how remain the best insight into understanding and shaping these processes.</p>
